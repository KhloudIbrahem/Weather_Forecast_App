Khloud Ibrahem (Solo).

Description of the project:
My project (Weather Forecast App) is very important in predicting the atmosphere of the day according to a given location in the search. It helps us to plan and what are we doing today according to the temperature. According to the location determined in the search the temperature, the humidity and the pressure is appeared in the screen for today. It could be used in many fields such as determining when to irrigate the plants to help the farmers in their work and save their efforts.

The Architecture and The Developments:
The architecture and developments of the project are built in the following:
the user enters the location which he \ she want to know the temperature in then clicks on the search button in the frontend screen. The program sends a request to the open weather API to get the information for this location. Then the API gets the current information of temperature for this location and sends it in the frontend of the user to see it in the screen. The screenshot shows the important part of the code that will be done in every action taken in the frontend screen.

Technologies used:
Javascript.
HTML.
CSS.
NodeJS.
Express
Open Weather API.

Successes:
I succeeded in developing a good, organized frontend screen for the user to be used-friendly.
I succeeded in knowing a free weather API contains very large amount of data about the current temperatures in the most of the worldâ€™s countries.
I succeeded in coding the backend software of the web application (Weather Forecast App) which can help us in many fields in the future.
I succeeded in building a good coloring for the user.

Challenges:
The most challenging thing in the project to get these amount of data to process it and showing it to the user.

Improvements:
In the future, Adding User Authentication for the application. It is now as simple as possible for user.
Making it more friendly to the user. By getting the weather information when press the enter key from the keyboard.
Improving the colors and the frontend screen to be more suitable for the user.
Adding more information about the weather.

Lessons learned:
Improved in html, css and javascript.
Improved in programming web applications.
New shape for the weather forecast app.
Improved in node.js and express.

Next steps for the project:
Using it in planning for meetings / commuting timing.
Using it in how to choose the travelling method (bus, plane, train) by knowing the weather in the destination city.
Using it in educating the farmers while irrigation according to the weather forecast to prevent loss of water.
Using it to plan how to prevent floods in the streets if it very rainy.

Conclusion Summary:
This project is very useful and helpful in preparing for today and next day at maximum. It is user friendly as it is simple for the user and using interactive photos for the user. I hope that you get useful and helpful information about the weather today.

THANK YOU.
